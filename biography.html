    <p> <q>… her poise is remarkable in such a young singer – her statuesque bearing does her no harm, ... Her voice is bright without being brassy, her phrasing musical and elegant …</q> - Melanie Eskenazi, Seen & Heard International </p>

    <p> Over the last few years, soprano Erica Eloff has steadily built her career on the concert platform to become a sought after soloist and recitalist. Praised in the media for her vocal authority and technical control, and a voice that is bright and well-produced across its range with great power at the top, she is a passionate and deeply musical performer.
    <br>
    <br>
  Erica's wide-ranging repertoire includes all of the major choral compositions including several lesser known works. As an active chamber musician and passionate performer of Lieder and contemporary music, Erica has presented world premiers of works by American, Argentinian, English and South African composers, including works specifically written for her by composers James Wilding, Augusto Arias and Hannes Taljaard.
    <br>
    <br>

As winner of the London Handel Singing Competition, Erica had the privilege of collaborating with Laurence Cummings and the London Handel Players on several occasions, including performing Handel's Messiah at St. George's. Her operatic experience includes the roles of Farnaspe (Adriano in Siria), Flowermaiden (Parsifal), Giovanna (Ernani), Chloë (Gruta de Ninfas), Ottone (Griselda), Galatea (Acis and Galatea), Meleagro (Atalanta), Euridice (Orfeo ed Euridice), Ilia (Idomeneo), Fiordiligi and Despina (Cosi fan tutte), First Lady and the Queen of the Night (Die Zauberflöte), Violetta (La Traviata), Tatyana (Eugene Onegin), Kate Pinkerton (Madama Butterfly), Dido and Belinda (Dido & Aeneas), Frasquita (Carmen), Adéle (Die Fledermaus) and Adina (L'elisir d'amore).
    <br>
    <br>
Erica's engagements for the 2017-18 season sees her reprise the title role of Floria Tosca at the Schlossfestspiele Schwerin (G. Puccini Tosca), as well as return to the role of The Queen of the Night (W.A. Mozart Die Zauberfloete) for Theater Lübeck. She continues her collaboration with Opera Settecento for various concerts, as well as joining The Hanover Band for their Christmas Messiah tour throughout the UK. For up to date information about the various chamber music recitals and concerts she participates in throughout the year, please visit her calender.

    <q>Everyone loves a winner. And, from the moment she began her final recital at the start of this year's Handel Singing Competition, the South African soprano Erica Eloff looked and sounded the part... and I can't wait to hear her again... She really inhabited each aria - and at the end was radiant with laughter as though she'd enjoyed every minute. We certainly did …</q> – Hilary Finch, The Times
